# Methodology
## Data Analysis:
1. Missing Values: Checked and confirmed no missing data.
2. Feature Engineering: Created age groups and dummy variables for categorical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Univariate Analysis: Calculated appointment show-up rates and analyzed feature distributions.
2. Bivariate Analysis: Used count plots to explore relationships between features and the NoShow variable.
3. Correlation Analysis: Assessed feature correlations with the target variable using heatmaps.

## Data Visualization:
Missing Values Plot: Displayed percentages of missing values.
Feature Distributions: Visualized distributions and show-up rates using count plots and heatmaps.

## Inferences:
Gender Distribution: More female patients, with similar show-up rates for both genders.
Appointment Days: No appointments on Sundays and fewer on Saturdays.
Age Groups: Consistent show-up rates across age groups.

## Health Conditions:
Scholarship: Lower show-up rate for patients with scholarships.
Hypertension: Higher show-up rate for patients with hypertension.
SMS Received: Lower show-up rate for patients who received SMS reminders.

## Results
Show-up Rate: 79.8% show-up, 20.2% no-show.

## Key Findings:
Female patients have more appointments but similar show-up rates.
Show-up rates are consistent across age groups.
Scholarship recipients and SMS-receivers show lower show-up rates.
